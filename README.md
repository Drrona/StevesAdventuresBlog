# StevesAdventuresBlog

A simple blog with content management, comments, and users (including admin dashboard). 

Used as an exercise to create a standalone blog connected to a local and/or remote database. Content is updated on the fly if a registered user or admin creates a post. 

Future Updates: 
Admin approval to make a user an author. 
Admin editing of user information. 
Image upload. Currently requires a link instead of an easy upload. Not very user friendly. 

Note: 
I do not own any of the Marvel content. I just used that as a theme. It is solely owned by Marvel and I do not intend on monetizing any of this.
